## About
Boilerplate for an easy start with react apps.

Created with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Basti Paintner](https://twitter.com/lItc0de).

Inspiration and many ideas taken from
[react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) and
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Thx a lot!

## Features

**Routing**

Client side routing out of the box with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

**Styling**

Awesome component based styling with
[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

**Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**

Save your work and have the page automatically rerendered without reloading!<br/>
-> Instantly see your changes with [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader).

**Lastest JavaScript features**

i.e. template strings, arrow functions, JSX syntax...

**Linting**

No commit without being lintet, to assure code quality and best practices.

**Bulletproof test setup**

Run Jest tests before each build! It's not possible to deploy with failing tests.

## Getting started
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/lItc0de/react-start.git`
- Get inside: `cd react-start`
- Install dependencies using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/): `yarn install`
- Run that thing on http://localhost:3000 with: `yarn start`

-> Now you are good to go and build your awsome project!

## Folder Structure

`/`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`build/` all your production ready compiled files  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`src/` all your source files  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`assets/` images, videos, icons, fonts, ...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`components/` all your components and component styles  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`styles/` all the reusable styles, shared throughout your components  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`App.jsx` your main component  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`globalStyles.js` in here you could set the font or other things, that should apply to the whole app  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`index.html` in here your app gets injected  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`index.js` this file injects your app in the index.html file and loads other dependencies  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
`tests/` in here you can write your tests


## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Starts the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will rerender if you make changes.

### `yarn build`

compiles your app for production use<br/>
you can find it then in the `build` folder

### `yarn serve`

starts an express server, that serves your production compiled app from the build folder

## `yarn prod`

does the two above steps: first builds the app, then serves it

### `yarn test`

runs your jest tests

### `yarn coverage`

runs your jest tests and prints coverage report

### `yarn watch`

runs your jest tests in watch mode

<h3 id="yarn-build-dll"><code>yarn build:dll</code></h3>

builds a DLL file for improving compile time in development (https://webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin)

## Routing

This setup uses the [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
from reacttraining.com  
For mor information please visit their [website](reacttraining.com/react-router)

## Styling

You can style your components with [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)  
With this you can write real `CSS` in `JavaScript`!  
Please check their [website](https://www.styled-components.com/) for further information

## Locales

For internationalisation we will use either:

[react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) or
[react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next)

## Testing

For testing we use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest): Jest is used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code
including React applications. One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated `zero-configuration` experience.


## Linting

- Lint your code before commiting with [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)<br>
  for git hooks we use [pre-commit](https://github.com/observing/pre-commit)
- **Configuration:**
  - Parser: [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint): Use for [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) and
  other experimantal features, that are not supportet by the [default parser](https://github.com/eslint/espree).
  - [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb): This package
  provides Airbnb's .eslintrc as an extensible shared config.
  - Env: Specify supportet platfroms
  - Plugins:
    - [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react): Adds linting rules for react
    - [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y): Static AST checker for
    [accessibility rules](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y) on JSX elements.
  - Parser Options: Specify the JavaScript language options you want to support as explained
  [here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-parser-options)
  - Rules: Overwrite default rules.
  - Settings: Add [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import), an ESLint plugin with rules
  that help validate proper imports.
