## Getting started
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/lItc0de/react-start.git`
- Move into repo: `cd react-start`
- Install modules using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/): `yarn install`
- Start app on http://localhost:3000: `yarn start`

Now you can start creating your app!

## Routing


## State management


## Styling

**Style loaders**

- [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader): The css-loader interprets `@import` and `url()` like
`import/require()` and will resolve them.

- [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader): Style loader for webpack to combine with `css-loader`

- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components): Visual primitives for the component age.
Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress üíÖ


## Locales


## Deployment


## Testing

For testing we use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest): Jest is used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code
including React applications. One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated `zero-configuration` experience.

## Assets

- [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader): Instructs webpack to emit the required object as file
and to return its public URL

- [url-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/url-loader): The `url-loader` works like the `file-loader`, but can
return a `DataURL` if the file is smaller than a byte limit.

- [image-webpack-loader](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader): Image loader module for webpack. Minify
`PNG`, `JPEG`, `GIF`, `SVG` and `WEBP` images with [imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin)<br/>
  **warning** image-webpack-loader > imagemin-pngquant > pngquant-bin > bin-build > download > gulp-decompress >
  gulp-util@3.0.8: gulp-util is deprecated - replace it, following the guidelines at
  https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-util-ca3b1f9f9ac5



## Linting

- Lint your code before commiting with [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)<br>
  for git hooks we use [pre-commit](https://github.com/observing/pre-commit)
- **Configuration:**
  - Parser: [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint): Use for [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) and
  other experimantal features, that are not supportet by the [default parser](https://github.com/eslint/espree).
  - [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb): This package
  provides Airbnb's .eslintrc as an extensible shared config.
  - Env: Specify supportet platfroms
  - Plugins:
    - [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react): Adds linting rules for react
    - [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y): Static AST checker for
    [accessibility rules](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y) on JSX elements.
  - Parser Options: Specify the JavaScript language options you want to support as explained
  [here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-parser-options)
  - Rules: Overwrite default rules.
  - Settings: Add [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import), an ESLint plugin with rules
  that help validate proper imports.

## Babel

### Plugins

  `"modules": false`
- [React preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react): Strip flow types and transform JSX into createElement
calls.
- [Stage-0 preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-0) includes:
